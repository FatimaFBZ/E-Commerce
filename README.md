# E-Commerce
# Description
This project will have the code available for the backend of an ecommerce store. It includes how to set up your database and predesigned routes. It does not have the front end build out and to best test your information you will need to use the application Insomnia

# Installation
This application requires node.js. Make sure this is installed on your computer first.
Clone this repository to your computer.
Open the server.js file in your terminal and run npm install. This will install all the dependancies to run this application.
Update the .env.EXAMPLE file, change variables in it to show your information and remove the ".EXAMPLE" ending on the file name when ready to use.
Run the Schema file through MySQL to establish the database. I, personally, prefer doing this in the workbench.
There is a provided "seeds" folder to prepopulate the database, if desired. You can populate this into your database by using node seeds/index.js in your terminal
Usage
Once your database is in place you can start your server by using node server.js in the terminal
You would then switch over to insomnia to test the different routes. Routes provided will account for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
